This book aims to be a complement to the 1st version [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/) book with translations of the labs into using the [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) set of packages.

The labs will be mirrored quite closely to stay as true to the original material.
