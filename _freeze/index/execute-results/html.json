The [website](https://emilhvitfeldt.github.io/ISLR-tidymodels-labs/index.html) is hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and the complete source is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/ISLR-tidymodels-labs).\n\nThis version of the book was built with R version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16) and Quarto version 1.4.104 and the following packages:\n\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|package      |version |source                                                 |\n|:------------|:-------|:------------------------------------------------------|\n|broom        |1.0.5   |CRAN (R 4.3.0)                                         |\n|corrr        |0.4.4   |CRAN (R 4.3.0)                                         |\n|dials        |1.2.0   |CRAN (R 4.3.0)                                         |\n|discrim      |1.0.1   |CRAN (R 4.3.0)                                         |\n|downlit      |0.4.3   |CRAN (R 4.3.0)                                         |\n|dplyr        |1.1.3   |CRAN (R 4.3.0)                                         |\n|factoextra   |1.0.7   |CRAN (R 4.3.0)                                         |\n|ggplot2      |3.4.3   |CRAN (R 4.3.0)                                         |\n|glmnet       |4.1-8   |CRAN (R 4.3.0)                                         |\n|infer        |1.0.5   |CRAN (R 4.3.0)                                         |\n|ISLR         |1.4     |CRAN (R 4.3.0)                                         |\n|ISLR2        |1.3-2   |CRAN (R 4.3.0)                                         |\n|kernlab      |0.9-32  |CRAN (R 4.3.0)                                         |\n|kknn         |1.3.1   |CRAN (R 4.3.0)                                         |\n|klaR         |1.7-2   |CRAN (R 4.3.0)                                         |\n|MASS         |7.3-60  |CRAN (R 4.3.0)                                         |\n|mclust       |6.0.0   |CRAN (R 4.3.0)                                         |\n|mixOmics     |6.24.0  |bioc_xgit (\\@e8cf785f5d4c9fd3691ed3ec8bd81c6f3d966bb3) |\n|modeldata    |1.2.0   |CRAN (R 4.3.0)                                         |\n|paletteer    |1.5.0   |CRAN (R 4.3.0)                                         |\n|parsnip      |1.1.1   |CRAN (R 4.3.0)                                         |\n|patchwork    |1.1.3   |CRAN (R 4.3.0)                                         |\n|poissonreg   |1.0.1   |CRAN (R 4.3.0)                                         |\n|proxy        |0.4-27  |CRAN (R 4.3.0)                                         |\n|purrr        |1.0.2   |CRAN (R 4.3.0)                                         |\n|randomForest |4.7-1.1 |CRAN (R 4.3.0)                                         |\n|readr        |2.1.4   |CRAN (R 4.3.0)                                         |\n|recipes      |1.0.8   |CRAN (R 4.3.0)                                         |\n|rpart        |4.1.19  |CRAN (R 4.3.0)                                         |\n|rpart.plot   |3.1.1   |CRAN (R 4.3.0)                                         |\n|rsample      |1.2.0   |CRAN (R 4.3.0)                                         |\n|scico        |1.5.0   |CRAN (R 4.3.0)                                         |\n|tibble       |3.2.1   |CRAN (R 4.3.0)                                         |\n|tidyclust    |0.1.2   |CRAN (R 4.3.0)                                         |\n|tidymodels   |1.1.1   |CRAN (R 4.3.0)                                         |\n|tidyr        |1.3.0   |CRAN (R 4.3.0)                                         |\n|tune         |1.1.2   |CRAN (R 4.3.0)                                         |\n|vip          |0.4.1   |CRAN (R 4.3.0)                                         |\n|workflows    |1.1.3   |CRAN (R 4.3.0)                                         |\n|workflowsets |1.0.1   |CRAN (R 4.3.0)                                         |\n|xgboost      |1.7.5.1 |CRAN (R 4.3.0)                                         |\n|yardstick    |1.2.0   |CRAN (R 4.3.0)                                         |\n:::\n",
