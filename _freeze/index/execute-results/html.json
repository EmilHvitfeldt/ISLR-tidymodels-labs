The [website](https://emilhvitfeldt.github.io/ISLR-tidymodels-labs/index.html) is hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and the complete source is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/ISLR-tidymodels-labs).\n\nThis version of the book was built with R version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23) and the following packages:\n\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|package      |version |source         |\n|:------------|:-------|:--------------|\n|broom        |1.0.1   |CRAN (R 4.2.0) |\n|corrr        |0.4.4   |CRAN (R 4.2.0) |\n|dials        |1.1.0   |CRAN (R 4.2.1) |\n|discrim      |1.0.0   |CRAN (R 4.2.0) |\n|downlit      |0.4.2   |CRAN (R 4.2.0) |\n|dplyr        |1.0.10  |CRAN (R 4.2.0) |\n|factoextra   |1.0.7   |CRAN (R 4.2.0) |\n|ggplot2      |3.4.0   |CRAN (R 4.2.1) |\n|glmnet       |4.1-4   |CRAN (R 4.2.0) |\n|infer        |1.0.3   |CRAN (R 4.2.0) |\n|ISLR         |1.4     |CRAN (R 4.2.0) |\n|ISLR2        |1.3-1   |CRAN (R 4.2.0) |\n|kernlab      |0.9-31  |CRAN (R 4.2.0) |\n|kknn         |1.3.1   |CRAN (R 4.2.0) |\n|klaR         |1.7-1   |CRAN (R 4.2.0) |\n|MASS         |7.3-57  |CRAN (R 4.2.1) |\n|mclust       |6.0.0   |CRAN (R 4.2.0) |\n|modeldata    |1.0.1   |CRAN (R 4.2.1) |\n|paletteer    |1.5.0   |CRAN (R 4.2.0) |\n|parsnip      |1.0.2   |CRAN (R 4.2.0) |\n|patchwork    |1.1.2   |CRAN (R 4.2.0) |\n|proxy        |0.4-27  |CRAN (R 4.2.0) |\n|purrr        |0.3.5   |CRAN (R 4.2.0) |\n|randomForest |4.7-1.1 |CRAN (R 4.2.0) |\n|readr        |2.1.3   |CRAN (R 4.2.0) |\n|recipes      |1.0.2   |CRAN (R 4.2.0) |\n|rpart        |4.1.16  |CRAN (R 4.2.1) |\n|rpart.plot   |3.1.1   |CRAN (R 4.2.0) |\n|rsample      |1.1.0   |CRAN (R 4.2.0) |\n|scico        |1.3.1   |CRAN (R 4.2.0) |\n|tibble       |3.1.8   |CRAN (R 4.2.0) |\n|tidymodels   |1.0.0   |CRAN (R 4.2.0) |\n|tidyr        |1.2.1   |CRAN (R 4.2.0) |\n|tune         |1.0.1   |CRAN (R 4.2.0) |\n|vip          |0.3.2   |CRAN (R 4.2.0) |\n|workflows    |1.1.0   |CRAN (R 4.2.0) |\n|workflowsets |1.0.0   |CRAN (R 4.2.0) |\n|xgboost      |1.6.0.1 |CRAN (R 4.2.0) |\n|yardstick    |1.1.0   |CRAN (R 4.2.0) |\n:::\n",
