# Linear Model Selection and Regularization

## Best Subset Selection

tidymodels does not currently support subset selection methods, and it unlikely to include it in the [near future](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66651033/stepwise-algorithm-in-tidymodels#comment117845482_66651033).

## Forward and Backward Stepwise Selection

tidymodels does not currently support forward and backward stepwise selection methods, and it unlikely to include it in the [near future](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66651033/stepwise-algorithm-in-tidymodels#comment117845482_66651033).
